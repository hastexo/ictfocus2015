Note: Question: what's the universal biggest challenge that
enterprises face when it comes to technology adoption?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/cost.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

Note: Is it cost, the necessity to keep expense down and margins high?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/scalable.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

Note: Or scalability: the ability to quickly adapt to massive growth in
demand, or in customer base, for your products and services?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/speed.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

Note: Or speed, the requirement to ramp up, innovate, and go to market quickly?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/costscalespeed.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
![scratch that](images/scratch.svg) <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Note: In fact, it's none of these.
Because while reduced cost, improved scalability and quick
time-to-market are key expected **benefits** of modern
technology, like cloud, like distributed storage, like software
defined networking...
... the universal #1 **challenge** that enterprises are facing ...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/smart_skilled_worker.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: ... is one of skill. More precisely, hiring people that know,
understand and can maintain these increasingly complex distributed
systems. So, if these skills are rare and in high demand, why don't we
build them?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/costscalespeed.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

Note: ... in a manner that's cost-effective, scalable, efficient and fast?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/distributed.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

Note: ... that works for distributed teams?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/no_match.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: Conventional, instructor-driven face-to-face training is
frequently no option, it's neither very cost-effective, nor very
scalable, nor very fast in building up a team's skill set.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/video_based.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: And most **self**-paced training relies on attendees watching an
instructor on video.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/learning.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: And self-studying documentation. And that's how you're supposed
to understand and be able to manage increasingly complex distributed
systems. Without ever actually touching one that you can also break with
impunity.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/astronaut_training.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: It's almost like putting astronauts in a lecture hall with study
books and a few tabletop exercises, ...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/astronaut_strapped.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: and then strapping them to a rocket and hurling them into space
without them ever setting foot in a realistic simulator.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/broken_model.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: That's a broken model. And we're here to fix it.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/help.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: We need learning environments that actually help you learn what
you want and need to learn.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/immersive.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: That come with immersive, realistic lab environments.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/interact_with_peers.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: That allow you to interact directly with your peers, in your
learning environment just as you would in your professional group.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/open_source.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: ... and do all that leveraging the momentum and speed of
open-source platforms that innovate rapidly and openly.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/openedx-logo.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: the Open edX learning management platform is one which is
already sweeping universities and academic institutions for its
superior management capabilities and flexibility, and that offers
these same qualities, also for professional education.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/openstack-logo.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: OpenStack is a cloud management and orchestration platform
reshaping the way organizations manage and run their data centers.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/openstack-edx-logo.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: And using these two platforms, we can provide a learning experience
that is directly and smoothly integrated with life-sized, complex
environments. This frees organizations from having to either maintain
a costly parallel training infrastructure, or to settle for
unrealistic scaled-down versions of complex environments.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/docker-logo.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: Imagine being able to give *each and every person* on your
virtualization team a massively scaleable container infrastructure,
using potentially hundreds of Docker containers.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/ceph-logo.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: Or every new hire on your storage team a whole distributed Ceph cluster to
play with in training.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Hadoop_logo.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: Or every one of your Big Data developers a full Hadoop cluster.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/costscalespeed.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: Cost-effective, scalable, fast...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/open_source.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: ... and open.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/openstack-edx-logo.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
Note: With Open edX and OpenStack coming together for better
professional learning.
